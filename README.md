## Getting Started

To start the application, you will need to run both the frontend and the backend in separate terminals.

To run the frontend, first make sure that you have both `npm` and `node` installed. Then run the following:

```bash
task frontend:install
task frontend:dev # or frontend:start
```

To run backend, first make sure you have `python3` installed. Then, run the following:

```bash
task backend:setup
task backend:dev # or backend:start
```

Alternatively, you can run both the frontend and backend at the same time with the following command:
```bash
task dev # or start
```
